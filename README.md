📚 Supervised Learning Algorithms 🧠
This repository contains implementations of various supervised learning algorithms. Each algorithm is designed to solve different types of problems and can be used for tasks such as classification and regression.

📋 Algorithms Included
The following supervised learning algorithms are implemented in this repository:

🌳 Decision Trees: A popular algorithm that uses a tree-like model to make decisions based on features.

📈 Linear Regression: A simple yet powerful algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

🌿 Random Forest: An ensemble algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions.

📊 Logistic Regression: A binary classification algorithm that models the probability of a certain event occurring.

🛠️ Usage
To use any of the algorithms, follow these steps:

Run the algorithm on your dataset by executing the main script or Jupyter notebook.
